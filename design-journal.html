        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies youâ€™d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response:
          I Feel so lost when it comes to anything digital so id like to feel a little more secure in that. I'm excited to learn the basics and maybe get more comfortable in html. I am not looking forward to anything in particular but the first project seems like it will introduce me to coding in a way that is engaging. </p>

        <p>Prompt: What are your initial thoughts on flex box vs grid? Are you drawn to one more than the other?</p>
        <p>Response:
          I don't feel cofortable with either but the flex grid system seems easier for me to understand. I think I'll end up preferring each one in their own circumstances.</p>

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>Prompt:What are you planning to do for Project 1?</p>
        <p>Response:
          I plan to show and display my favorite display typefaces paired with my favorite color combinations. I want to have text that directs the reader to the foundry and text that tells the hex codes for the colors. I want to highlight some of my favorite type foundries and their trial fonts. Trial fonts are accessibe so I think it would be fun to show them off. I think my goal audience is other students because these fonts are fun, well designed and free to use for student work.</p>

        <h2>Week Four</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Read this short article https://hbr.org/2019/08/learning-is-supposed-to-feel-uncomfortable and this one on resistance https://www.mindful.org/the-neuroscience-of-resistance-and-how-to-overcome-it/. Considering these articles, make a list of 5 things to keep you going when you feel resistance or discomfort.</p>
        <p>Response:
           When I feel resitance or discomfort, its important for me to remember that work and activity are natural. We are made to be productive and have and reach goals. I need to let myself sit in and work through uncomfortable feelings. I am not good at taking a step back but I could work on that as well. I let discomfort easily become fear because I hate being challenged. Having a hard time, however, has always resulted in my best work and I forget that. </p>
